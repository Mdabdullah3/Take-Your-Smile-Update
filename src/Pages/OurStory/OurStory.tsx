From the beginning, you had the perfect sense for the vision that we wanted (but I'm sure never articulated as clearly as we could), and the final product was beyond our wildest dreams. Everything was so perfectly executed - we're still pinching ourselves that it actually happened and went so smoothly! You were able to stay on top of a million moving pieces, and did it all with a smile and such a positive attitude.",

Carolyn doesn't miss ANY detail, for example, the day before the wedding, I asked Carolyn to place custom blankets on my seat and my husband's seat as a surprise to my husband. The blankets had quotes we say to each other. Low and behold, they were sitting nicely on both of our chairsThere are many planners,",

My daughter and her fiancé are living out of the country and I do not know how we would have managed without Lauren’s dedication to keeping us on track with contracts and help with finding the best vendors. Her kindness and efficiency made a complicated weekend with people coming in from out of the country so easy, as she took care of every detail. We think the world of her and my daughter had the most spectacular wedding!!",

The hundreds of emails, coordination of all the vendors, the timelines, joining us at all of the vendor meetings, the last minute changes/updates and her mind reading abilities when I couldn't articulate properly what I wanted. Those things were all before the wedding day",

Nevertheless, my fiancé was not thrilled about the idea of hiring a planner, but he agreed to consider it, so we met with Lauren of LK Events. After meeting Lauren, I knew right away that we should to hire her, and the doubts that my fiancé had were gone as well.",

So many things could have gone wrong - i.e. COVID, tornados, intense families lol - but from day one Carolyn was professional, in control, kind, supportive, honest, transparent and just a generally lovely person to be working with. Our wedding was EXACTLY what we wanted and we couldn't be happier.",
